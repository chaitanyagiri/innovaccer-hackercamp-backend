# Tweetit
A twitter bot inspired from [twitter-bot-bootstrap
](https://github.com/spences10/twitter-bot-bootstrap) 
I saw many limitations to it so I added many features to it.

## Features of Tweetit

* Regularly re-tweeting tweets from your desired set of keywords.
* Replying as soon as a user follows you.
* Liking tweets from your desired set of keywords.
* Following people having similar interests.
* Gathering trending keywords and hash-tags and collecting articles from more than 5000 websites and tweeting them.
* Replying sensibly to tweets by sentimental analysis.

Do mark a star if you liked the project. It really motivates me to do amazing things.
